Be in the loop! Easily add any HTML, CSS, JavaScript or PHP to the begining or end of a post. Great for when plugins forget to add this ability.

== Description ==

Be in the loop!

Not all plugins provide a way to automatically attach code before or after the post content. Or you might have some other HTML, CSS or JavaScript you’d like to include with every post. Now’s your chance. With In The Loop you can easily add any code you like to your posts and pages, and not have to do any messy edits to your theme files either.

The plugin provides an options panel with two input boxes. One is for content you want to appear before your post, the other for after it. Each box comes with a set of options to control whether to show it on Teasers, Single Posts, Pages, The Feed and whether or not to execute PHP.

== Installation ==

1. Download the in-the-loop.zip file, unzip and upload the whole directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Paste HTML, CSS, JavaScript and/or PHP into one of the input boxes provided on the In The Loop options page, and click `Update Options`.
1. Select the locations you would like your code to show up before and/or after.
1. If you include PHP code, be sure to wrap it in PHP tags, and check off the option under that input box to enable it to execute your code.
1. Smile about your blog's new functionality!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I think I'm doing it wrong. I put in some PHP code, checked the box, and saved it, but now nothing is showing up, including the plain jane HTML that I put in there, too. =

Make sure there aren't any PHP errors being generated by your code. If any of your code errors, it won't be able to finish parsing it. Also, your PHP code must be syntactically correct as well as echo any content you want shown in order to function properly.
